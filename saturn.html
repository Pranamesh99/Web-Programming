    <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is a gas giant renowned for its striking and extensive ring system, which is the most prominent and expansive in the Solar System. With a diameter of approximately 116,460 kilometers, Saturn is the second-largest planet, following Jupiter.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> Approximately 116,460 km, making it the second-largest planet in the Solar System.</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> Roughly 29.46 Earth years, as it takes Saturn this long to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> About 10.7 hours, indicating that a day on Saturn is relatively short.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Approximately 1.43 billion kilometers, placing it far from our star.</li>
        <li><strong>Moons:</strong> Saturn has at least 83 known moons, including Titan, the largest moon and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter's Ganymede.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Rings and Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>The rings of Saturn are composed mainly of ice particles, with varying amounts of dust and rocky debris. These rings are incredibly thin but span vast distancesâ€”up to 120,700 kilometers across. They are divided into multiple distinct sections, with the main rings named A, B, and C. The atmosphere of Saturn is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other gases such as methane and ammonia. It has powerful storms, including the iconic hexagonal jet stream at its north pole, and high-speed winds that can reach up to 1,800 kilometers per hour.</p>
    
    <h2>Exploration</h2>
    <p>Saturn has been a target of several space missions over the years. The most famous of these is the Cassini-Huygens mission, which provided detailed data about the planet, its rings, and its moons. Launched in 1997, Cassini orbited Saturn for nearly 13 years, sending back stunning images and valuable scientific data. The Huygens probe, part of the Cassini mission, even landed on Titan, revealing insights into its icy surface and thick atmosphere. More recently, the Dragonfly mission plans to explore Titan further by studying its complex organic chemistry and potential for prebiotic chemistry.</p>
