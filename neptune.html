        <h1>Neptune: The Blue Giant</h1>

    <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our Solar System. It is a large gas giant known for its striking deep blue color, caused by methane gas in its atmosphere. Neptune has the strongest winds in the Solar System, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> Approximately 49,244 kilometers, which is similar in size to Uranus.</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 165 Earth years. It takes Neptune this long to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> About 16 hours. A day on Neptune is relatively short.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Roughly 4.5 billion kilometers, making it the most distant planet in the Solar System.</li>
        <li><strong>Moons:</strong> Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most prominent. Triton is unique because it orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction, which suggests it may have been captured by the planet's gravity in the past.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Atmosphere and Composition</h2>
    <p>Neptune’s atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it its characteristic blue color by absorbing red and yellow light. This methane gas also plays a role in Neptune’s greenhouse effect, warming its upper layers despite its great distance from the Sun. The planet’s atmosphere is dynamic, with visible high-altitude clouds and a large dark storm called the Great Dark Spot, which is similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. The winds in Neptune’s atmosphere are the strongest in the Solar System, reaching speeds up to 2,100 kilometers per hour, driven by the planet’s rapid rotation and internal heat.</p>
    
    <h2>Exploration</h2>
    <p>Neptune was visited by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. This mission provided the first close-up images and detailed data about Neptune’s atmosphere, rings, and moons. Voyager 2’s flyby revealed a complex system of faint rings, 14 known moons, and a turbulent atmosphere with high-altitude clouds and large storms. The most prominent of these moons is Triton, which is also one of the coldest places in the Solar System. Voyager 2’s data remain essential for scientists studying the outer Solar System, and there are currently no plans for new missions to Neptune, though it continues to be an object of interest for future exploration.</p>
