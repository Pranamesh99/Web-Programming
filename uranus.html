        <h1>Uranus: The Tilted Ice Giant</h1>

    <p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant with a unique blue-green color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It has a distinctive tilt of about 98 degrees, which makes it appear to be rolling along its orbit, unlike the other planets in the Solar System.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> Approximately 50,724 km, making it slightly larger than the Earth.</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 84 Earth years, as it takes Uranus this long to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> About 17.2 hours, indicating that a day on Uranus is quite short.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Approximately 2.87 billion kilometers, placing it far from our star.</li>
        <li><strong>Moons:</strong> Uranus has at least 27 known moons, including Titania, Oberon, Miranda, and Ariel.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Atmosphere and Composition</h2>
    <p>Uranus has a thick, gaseous atmosphere composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a significant presence of methane. This methane absorbs red light, giving Uranus its distinctive blue-green color. The planet’s axis is tilted at an extreme angle of about 98 degrees, causing seasons that can last for over 20 years. These extreme seasons lead to dramatic changes in weather patterns across its surface.</p>
    
    <h2>Exploration</h2>
    <p>Uranus was visited by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986. The mission provided a wealth of data about the planet’s atmosphere, its faint ring system, and its moons. Voyager 2 captured the first close-up images of Uranus and revealed details about its dynamic system of 13 known rings and at least 27 moons. Despite its distance from the Sun, Uranus remains an object of scientific interest due to its unique characteristics and the potential for studying the outer solar system.</p>
